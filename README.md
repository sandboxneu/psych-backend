# Sandbox Psych Backend

A simple shared backend to run Northeastern Sandbox's custom online psychology experiments.

## Required Setup

Create a `.env` file containing a directory on your machine for storing config and collected data files. 

```

```
On Windows you might need `\\` instead of `/`. Not sure.
